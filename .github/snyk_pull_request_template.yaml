  The auto-generated PR addresses {{ issue_count }} issues by upgrading {{ package_name }} from {{ package_from }} to {{ package_to }}.

  More details on these issues can be found at [Snyk]({{ snyk_project_url }}).

  {{ #is_container_pr }}
  Snyk recommends upgrading the container base image to {{container.recommended_base_image_name }}. We currently use 
  {{ container.current_base_image_name }}. Snyk's recommendation may not be the latest version of base image available - just one
  that Snyk knows about that has fewer issues than our current issue. Be careful about accepting this PR blindly - it may make more sense
  to close it and use the latest available base image.
