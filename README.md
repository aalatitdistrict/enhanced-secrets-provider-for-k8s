CyberArk Secrets Provider for Kubernetes

The CyberArk Secrets Provider for Kubernetes enables you to use secrets stored and managed in the CyberArk Vault 
using DAP and consume them in your Kubernetes application containers. To do so, the CyberArk Secrets 
Provider for Kubernetes image runs as an init container and provides the Conjur secrets, required by the pod, 
from DAP.
